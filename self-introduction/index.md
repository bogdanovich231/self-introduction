## Hi, this is a short introductory video about me, let's get introduced!
My name is Tatiana, I'm 18 years old. I'm a frontend developer with experience as a SOFTWARE ENGINEER assistant at BMW. 
I have a passion for creating beautiful and interactive user interfaces for web applications.

My history of fascination with computers began when I was a child. 
I was always fascinated by technology and spent a lot of time at the computer, exploring different programs and games. My curiosity eventually led me to want to develop my own applications and user interface.
In order to fulfill my dream, two years ago, I began to actively study the field of IT, tried programming in different languages, but stopped at JS and went to a European university in the field of mobile application development. During my studies I'm learning Python programming principles, algorithms,  App development and user interface design, and from next year I will study Java programming language. The knowledge and skills I get every day is the basis of my professional growth.

After graduation, I want to start working as a software developer. While studying, I continue to practice and improve my skills in various web technologies. 
>I am sure that constant learning and self-development are the key factors of success and progress in the IT-industry.

I also have design skills and knowledge of graphics tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Figma, and Acrobat . This helps me in creating attractive user interfaces.
I also have a hobby, writing bash scripts and using ubuntu for self-development, and of course it will come in handy for setting up servers in the future.

Overall, I am a young and ambitious front-end developer, ready to take on any challenge and striving for continuous development. 
I believe that the combination of my experience in mobile app development and front-end development makes me a valuable addition to the team.

About the last project and problems I can name only one problem, it is the lack of time and plus short deadlines, if it concerns courses. I also have a problem, 
I am in a constant stream of knowledge and because of this it becomes hard to keep up everywhere, but I like this and it only adds to my self-confidence.

That's all, if you have any questions, please contact me, I will be happy to talk to you. Thank you for listening, I apologize for my terrible English
